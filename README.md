# signal-slot-benchmarks

Comprehensive benchmarks for a majority of GitHub c++ signal slot implementations and others.
<br/>
**_Boost, as well as C++17 support, is required to build this project._**

Foreword
--------

These benchmarks do not accurately depict real world usage patterns seen in the wild.
<br/>
However, these benchmarks were designed to provide impartial results regardless of implementation.
<br/>
It is my goal to take what I've learned from these results and apply this knowledge into making nano-signal-slot better.

Maintainers
-----------

Generally, implementations that get added to this benchmark project aren't regularly updated by me unless asked to do so.
If you are a maintainer of a referenced library, I encourage you to fork this project and create pull requests to expedite updates.

Benchmark Algorithms
--------------------

_The individual benchmark algorithms are completely generic through templates._

| Algorithm | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| [validation_assert](https://github.com/NoAvailableAlias/signal-slot-benchmarks/blob/master/benchmark.hpp#L19) | Make sure each signal implementation is functioning correctly. |
| [construction](https://github.com/NoAvailableAlias/signal-slot-benchmarks/blob/master/benchmark.hpp#L48) | Time the construction of a Signal to an N number of Foo instances. |
| [destruction](https://github.com/NoAvailableAlias/signal-slot-benchmarks/blob/master/benchmark.hpp#L69) | Time the destruction of a Signal and associated Connections to N number of Foo instances. |
| [connection](https://github.com/NoAvailableAlias/signal-slot-benchmarks/blob/master/benchmark.hpp#L95) | Time Signal connections to a randomized N number of Foo instances. |
| [emission](https://github.com/NoAvailableAlias/signal-slot-benchmarks/blob/master/benchmark.hpp#L118) | Time the duration of an N slot emission. |
| [combined](https://github.com/NoAvailableAlias/signal-slot-benchmarks/blob/master/benchmark.hpp#L143) | Time construction, destruction, connection, and emission together. |
| [threaded](https://github.com/NoAvailableAlias/signal-slot-benchmarks/blob/master/benchmark.hpp#L166) | Same as the "combined" test except threaded using a shared Signal. |
